    <h1>How Students Can Organize Their Daily Schedule</h1>
    <hr />

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        Every <b>learner</b> aims to lead a <strong>well-planned</strong> and 
        <em>balanced</em> lifestyle. Proper time organization enables them to study 
        efficiently, relax, and stay fit. A <u>daily schedule</u> supports students 
        in maintaining focus and reducing stress. 
        <br /><br />
        As the famous quote says, 
        <blockquote>
            "The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet." 
            – Aristotle
        </blockquote>
        This highlights the <i>value</i> of time management and discipline in a student’s routine.

    <h3>Tips for an Effective Routine</h3>

    <p>
        To begin with, students should <ins>wake up early</ins> so they can start 
        their day with energy. Eating a healthy breakfast and doing some light exercise 
        keeps both body and mind active. They can prepare a <span style="color:blue;">study schedule</span> 
        and try to stick to it consistently. For instance, they might study for 2<sup>hours</sup> 
        in the morning and review subjects they <del>avoid</del> <ins>find challenging</ins> later in the day.
        <br /><br />
        It’s equally important to include short breaks during study time. Engaging in 
        activities like music, drawing, or playing games refreshes the mind. 
        <q>Proper planning turns dreams into goals</q> — a thought every student should keep in mind.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        To sum up, a daily schedule allows students to excel not only in 
        <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics">STEM</abbr> 
        but also in creative fields. A disciplined plan brings harmony and 
        satisfaction to life. Always remember — steady effort and smart planning 
        are more valuable than working endlessly without direction.
